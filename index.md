### Bio & Research Interests
I am currently a first year Ph.D. student in School of Geospatial Engineering and Science, Sun Yat-Sen University, under the supervision of Professor [Yiping Chen](https://ting-devin-han.github.io/Epingpages.github.io/). I graduated from the School of Computer Engineering at Jimei University for my master's degree, where my advisor was Professor [Guorong Cai](https://cec.jmu.edu.cn/info/1008/4123.htm).

My research interests are deep learning theories, methods, and applications for 3D point cloud processing in remote sensing.
